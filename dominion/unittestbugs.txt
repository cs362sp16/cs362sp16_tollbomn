My first two card tests (council room and smithy) failed on checking that the handcount was
correct. This could indicate drawCard is not properly updating the handcounts.
Card test 4 (salvager) also failed, indicating that the discarded card and the handcount are,
again, not working. This could indicate an issue with the playcard function, which I used
to activate the cards. I may try direct calls to card effect in the future to see if it fixes
the error.
