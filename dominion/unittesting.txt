This would indicate the tests of the cards are not extending the test coverage. This may
indicate playcard() is not calling card effect, or perhaps my tests did not set it up
properly. I will try a better testing effort to see if I can get it to work in the future.
I will likely initate the whole game before I set the hand and the deck rather than just
making sets, as all the unit tests seemed to work quite well.
