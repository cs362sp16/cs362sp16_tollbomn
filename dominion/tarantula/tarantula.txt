I tested tarantula on my occasionally failing random adventurer test code. Once I made a slight modification such that the 
deck would never have enough treasure, and ran 50 times. Using the formula, it was determined that the while loop
(while drawntreasure < 2) was the most suspicious, which agreed with my earlier conclusions. Localizing the bug in adventurer
to the loop solidified my own conclusions that the bug was there with another tool. Although there is little purpose in using
a debugging tool like this to locate a bug you already know exists (and where it is), the power of it can be clearly seen. This
tool could clearly be very useful in debugging a large program, especially if you were not the only one to work on it. 
Debugging probably takes me personally 2-3 times as much time as actually writing code, and a significant part of that is
looking for the bug. Tools like tarantula can assist the programmer in finding his errors sooner, and have a better understanding
of what could be causing the program to fail.
