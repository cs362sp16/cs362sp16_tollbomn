There is an infinite loop in the adventurer card.
Consider a case where the deck consists entirely of cards that are not treasures (or less than 2 treasures).
Example Hand/deck/discard contents:
Hand
[0]: adventurer
[1]: copper
[2]: copper
[3]: copper
[4]: copper

Deck
[0]: estate
[1]: village

Discard
[0]: estate
[1]: village
[2]: duchy
[3]: seahag
[4]: smithy

Having 0 or 1 treasure(s) in the deck or discard will make the while loop go on indefinitely, as drawntresure will always be 0,
or 1.
